# THREE_TransformController_UI_UX

## Link to the Application
- https://bit.ly/TransformControls

## Section 1 - Overview 
- This application's primary goal is to be a prototype for an application I wish to finish in the near future. 


## Section 2 - Purpose 
- This application's primary function is to be more efficient by integrating Δs or Realities of Change© or a WebSpace©. Here, the user will be in a simulated enviornment where they can view multiple websites within their own space which they ideally will be able to customize to their will. They will be able to visualize data traveling through time, view multipel websites at one time, and have access to transformation functions to fully utilize their WebSpace©.


## Section 3 - Directions

- Before understanding how to use this application, the user needs to understand the three different phases of this application. 
  - Phase 1: Home Menu < Start Menu >
  - Phase 2: Exploring < 1st person experience >
  - Phase 3: Item interaction < Using Mouse to interact with Δs >


- When the application phases are understood then the next step is to understand the Menus of the application.

- From here, its exploring and solving problems! The instructions are in the application. 



## Section 4 - Notes 
- No current notes. 


## Section 5 - Summary 
- This project is a smaller application I would like to build into a much larger application one day. I enjoyed building it and learning about the different types of 3D transformations in the perspective of coding.
